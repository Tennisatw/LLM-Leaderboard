大语言模型定量能力评估表

新发布的gpt5不出意外地拿到了第一名。都说gpt5的使用手感不如预期，文字生成能力不如gpt4.5，但是在各项能力上还是力压群雄。“既具有很高的原始性能（推理、数学），又具有很强的用户偏好分数（gpt5自评）” 只要有钱，无脑冲openai家的pro会员。
	
老马说grok是世界上最聪明的模型，他还真不是瞎说。此外，先不论grok的能力有多强，它有（美式）二次元虚拟角色这一点就已经把其他模型秒了。老马还是太会了啊。
	
刚才说有钱人无脑冲gpt5，其实排名第四的gemini-2.5-pro是可以在google ai studio中免费使用的。虽然有限额，但google账号是可以无限注册的，所以真的是纯白送。作为唯一一个能长期和openai抗衡的公司，google做事还是很让人舒服的。
	
颇让我意外的是阿里的qwen3竟然排名这么高，尤其是在数学和代码能力上，绝对的t1。其实中国厂商的模型在这张表上整体有点虚低。如果添加一个多语言能力的话，这些模型的排名还能再高一点。另，deepseek什么时候更新啊。
	
虽然claude opus的代码能力不强，但Claude Code还是太舒服了。
	
唯一真神gpt-4o排在了30整，廉颇老矣。幸亏我赶紧把这个表做出来了，下一次排名就不一定有了。
	
新出的claude-opus-4.1也很强，arena text的排名相当高，只是其他榜单还没有更新。

Made a table summarizes the performance of popular large language models across well-known benchmark leaderboards.

As expected, the newly released GPT-5 took the top spot. While some say GPT-5 doesn’t feel as impressive in use—its text generation reportedly trails GPT-4.5—in raw capability, it still dominates the competition. “It combines exceptional core performance (reasoning, math) with high user preference scores (self-assessed by GPT-5).” If you’ve got the money, it’s a no-brainer to subscribe to OpenAI’s Pro plan.

Elon claims Grok is the smartest model in the world—and he’s not entirely bluffing. Regardless of how strong Grok actually is, the fact that it comes with an anime-style (American take) virtual persona gives it a unique edge over other models. He really knows how to play the game.

While GPT-5 is the obvious choice for those willing to spend, Gemini 2.5 Pro—ranked fourth—is actually free to use on Google AI Studio. Though usage is limited, you can register unlimited Google accounts, effectively making it a free-for-all. As the only company consistently able to rival OpenAI, Google’s offerings are refreshingly user-friendly.

I was quite surprised to see Alibaba’s Qwen3 ranked so highly, especially in math and coding where it's solidly Tier 1. Overall, Chinese-developed models seem slightly underrated on this chart. If multilingual capability were factored in, their rankings would likely rise even further. Also—when will DeepSeek release an update?

Although Claude Opus isn't particularly strong in coding, Claude Code is just such a joy to use.

The GOAT, GPT-4o, sits precisely at rank 30—clearly showing its age. Good thing I managed to compile this table now; it might not make the cut next time.

The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 is also very capable, ranking highly on Arena Text, though other benchmark updates are still pending.
